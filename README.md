# em-sdk

The focal public repo for the EM programnming language and runtime, as documented in [docs.openem.org](https://docs.openem.org/).

At present, this repo _only_ houses **Issues** and **Discussions** pages for EM; see [Discussing EM](https://docs.openem.org/discuss/) for more guidance.

We'll shortly use this repo to archive downloadable **Releases** of the `@openem/em-sdk` package described in [Installing EM](https://docs.openem.org/install/).

Over time, the `em-foundation/em-sdk` repo will of course publish the sources of the EM language and its runtime.
